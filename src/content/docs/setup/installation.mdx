## Steps

### 1. Installing the package

The package can be installed using npm, using the command shown below. This package provides the custom css classes used to achieve the styling shown in this documentation.

```bash
npm install @thg-altitude/standalone-components-css
```

The npm page for the package can be found **[here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@thg-altitude/standalone-components-css)**.

### 2. Importing the package

Within your main application file, giving all subsequent files access to these custom css classes.

```js
import "@thg-altitude/standalone-components-css";
```

### 3. Creating components

This documentation provides examples of components that make use of these custom css classes. To create a component, such as a [button](/components/button), simply copy the provided code example into your codebase. This approach allows you to use this as a starting point, and build any additional functionality you may need ontop of this component, giving you full control over its appearance and functionality.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/buttons/PrimaryButtonHighEmphasis.html">
  <PrimaryButtonHighEmphasis />
</ShowComponent>

**[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** allows for easy editing of the styles beyond your **[configured theming](/setup/theme)**. Below is an example fo using it to alter the buttons appearance.

<ShowComponent filePath="../../../doc-helpers//PrimaryButtonCustom.html">
  <PrimaryButtonCustom />
</ShowComponent>{" "}
