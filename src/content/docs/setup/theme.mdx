The components library provides a theming framework that can be used within these components and beyond on your entire site, helping to maintain a cohesive design system.

The framework acts through a number of layers, where each one feeds down into the next. Its fully customisable implementation allows you to decouple or change these connections at any point, simply by overriding the css variables within your project.

1 - **Global** variables are at the top of the style tree, and propagate through to the lower levels. This allows you to re theme a site with only a handful of variable changes.

2 - **Primitive** variables are computed from global variables, such as shades of a global colour.

3 - **Semantic** variables apply context to the global and primitive variables. These can exist as a specified primitive, such as default, light or dark shades of a colour. THey can also exist in a broader context, where foreground, background and border styles are given as sets that can be reused throughout. Classes are also provided in these cases to improve the developer experience and promote consistent styling.

4 - **Component** variables are specific to each component. _These are documented on each components page respectively_

In order to apply your own themes on top of the base styles, simply define the variables you want to change, and they will update across your site where they are used.

## Colour Palette

The color scheme of a site is defined using the global variables shown below. From this, CSS calculations will generate a range of primitive shades centered around the global variable. These can be individually changed by overriding their css definitions.

Semantic shades have been labeled. Default shades are provided when no suffix is given, such as `--color-primary'. Other semantic shades, such as 'light' are given by using the label as the suffix, e.g. `--color-primary-light`

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/sample-css/colour.css">
  <ColorScheme />
</ShowComponent>

## Semantic Sets

A number of categories of element styles are provided. These should be applied throughout a site to maintain visual consistency, and allow for site wide theming at the css layer - although they can be overridden (for example by tailwind classes) at each use case without effecting other instances.

Each set defines the background, foreground and border colours at both a default state, and in states where there is interaction. For each set, there is a base css class, which will apply only the default state styling, and a interactive class, which includes all interactive and default state styles, applied using appropriate CSS directives.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/sample-css/semanticColours.css">
  <SemanticColors />
</ShowComponent>

## Typography

Below are the primitive typography styles that form the foundation of our text elements.

These styles can be customized to match your brand's typography guidelines. Mobile and desktop sizes can be defined.
These will automatically get used by the default responsive sizes, which are used within the components.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/sample-css/typography.css">
  <TypographyDisplay />
</ShowComponent>

## Corners

As with colours, the corner styles are applied using primitive and semantic fields as shown below. These allow you to set the 'roundness' of your components.

_(If you want to achieve no rounding across all components, simply set all primitive sizes to 0px)_

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/sample-css/corners.css">
  <CornerDisplay />
</ShowComponent>

## Shadows

Shadows are defined using primitive and semantic variables. The primitive shadows provide a range of elevation levels, while semantic shadows apply these to specific UI elements.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/sample-css/shadows.css">
  <ShadowDisplay />
</ShowComponent>

## Animations

Animation speeds are defined using CSS variables to maintain consistency across different components. These variables control the duration of various animations throughout your project.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/sample-css/animation.css">
  <AnimationDisplay />
</ShowComponent>
