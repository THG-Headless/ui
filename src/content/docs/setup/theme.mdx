Default CSS variables are provided, which match the style shown in the documentation. These can be overwritten within your project by defining the specified CSS variables.

On this page, variables that effect many components are documented, defining the over arching design system of your site. Beyond this, additional CSS variables exist for specific components. Documentation of these values can be found on component specific pages, and should be added to the CSS configuration, as with the examples below.

## Colour Schemes

The colour scheme is made up of two parts:

**Primitive Colours** are the color pallet of your site. For many purposes, just setting the primitive colours to fit your sites design language will be sufficient, as they dictate all the colours throughout all components.

**Semantic Colours** link the primitive colours colours to their applications within the components. For many cases, the default values for these will be suitable, and as such they do not need defining within your CSS as they will use the default associations made within the CSS package. However, as many of these as needed can be customised simply by defining it within your CSS, either to a unique colour or a different primitive using `var(--primitive-name)`.

Below is the default colour scheme for the site. This is already included in the CSS package and will be applied to the components by default. To start applying your custom theme, simply copy the code below into your projects CSS, and configure the values.

_(Any variables you don't wish to customise, such as semantic associatons, can be removed from this code, allowing the default fallbacks to be used instead.)_

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/sample-css/colour.css">
  <ColorScheme />
</ShowComponent>

## Corners

As with colours, the corner styles are applied using primitive and semantic fields as shown below. These allow you to set the 'roundness' of your components.

_(If you want to achieve no rounding across all components, simply set all primitive sizes to 0px)_

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/sample-css/corners.css">
  <CornerDisplay />
</ShowComponent>

## Shadows

Shadows are defined using primitive and semantic variables. The primitive shadows provide a range of elevation levels, while semantic shadows apply these to specific UI elements.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/sample-css/shadows.css">
  <ShadowDisplay />
</ShowComponent>

## Typography

Below are the primitive typography styles that form the foundation of our text elements.

These styles can be customized to match your brand's typography guidelines. Mobile and desktop sizes can be defined.
These will automatically get used by the default responsive sizes, which are used within the components.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/sample-css/typography.css">
  <TypographyDisplay />
</ShowComponent>

## Animations

Animation speeds are defined using CSS variables to maintain consistency across different components. These variables control the duration of various animations throughout your project.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/sample-css/animation.css">
  <AnimationDisplay />
</ShowComponent>
