Default CSS variables are provided, which match the style shown in the documentation. These can be overwritten within your project by defining the specified CSS variables.

On this page, variables that effect many components are documented, defining the over arching design system of your site. Beyond this, additional CSS variables exist for specific components. Documentation of these values can be found on component specific pages, and should be added to the CSS configuration, as with the examples below.

## Colour Schemes
The colour scheme is made up of two parts:

**Primitive Colours** are the color pallet of your site. For many purposes, just setting the primitive colours to fit your sites design language will be sufficient, as they dictate all the colours throughout all components.

**Semantic Colours** link the primitive colours colours to their applications within the components. For many cases, the default values for these will be suitable, and as such they do not need defining within your CSS as they will use the default associations made within the CSS package. However, as many of these as needed can be customised simply by defining it within your CSS, either to a unique colour or a different primitive using `var(--primitive-name)`.

Below is the default colour scheme for the site. This is already included in the CSS package and will be applied to the components by default. To start applying your custom theme, simply copy the code below into your projects CSS, and configure the values. 

*(Any variables you don't wish to customise, such as semantic associatons, can be removed from this code, allowing the default fallbacks to be used instead.)*
