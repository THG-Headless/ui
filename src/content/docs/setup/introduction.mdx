Welcome to the documentation for the THG Altitude stand alone component library.

The standalone component css library consists of two parts:
1. The **[css package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@thg-altitude/standalone-components-css)**
2. HTML templates of components

This pure html and css approach provides a fully customisable, lightweight and framework agnostic approach to implementing components.
