## Site Variable Colours

The design systems colour palette is derived from the following site variables. These can be overridden to change the appearance of the entire site.

<SiteColours />

## Extended Colour Palette

The color scheme of a site is defined using the site variables shown below. From this, CSS calculations will generate a range of primitive shades centered around the site variable, where the site colour is 500 on a scale of 50 _(lightest)_ to 950 _(darkest)_. These can be individually changed by overriding their css definitions.

Semantic shades have been labeled. Default shades are provided when no suffix is given, such as `--color-primary`. Other semantic shades, such as 'light' are given by using the label as the suffix, e.g. `--color-primary-light`

<ColorScheme />
