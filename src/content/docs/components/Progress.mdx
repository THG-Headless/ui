## Progress Bar

The Progress Bar component provides a visual indicator for showing progress, loading states, or proportional values. It supports customization through CSS variables and is fully accessible with proper ARIA attributes.

<ShowComponent>
  <ProgressBar />
</ShowComponent>

### Overview

Progress bars communicate the status of processes that take time to complete, such as loading content, uploading files, or indicating the completion level of multi-step processes. The component uses a simple percentage-based system ranging from 0% to 100% and can be styled with different skins to match your design requirements.

### Usage

The progress bar component is implemented with a single HTML element and uses CSS pseudo-elements to create the visual indicator. The progress value is controlled through the `--progress-value` CSS variable, which accepts values from 0 (empty) to 1 (full).

#### HTML

```html
<div
  class="skin-primary progress"
  style="--progress-value: 0.5"
  role="progressbar"
  aria-valuemin="0"
  aria-valuemax="100"
  aria-valuenow="50"
  aria-label="Loading progress: 50%"
></div>
```

### CSS Variables

| Variable              | Default Value        | Description                       |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `--progress-value`    | `0`                  | Progress fill value (0 to 1)      |
| `--progress-height`   | `1rem`               | Height of the progress bar        |
| `--progress-rounding` | `var(--radius-site)` | Border radius of the progress bar |

The component uses two key colors that should be set in your skin or theme:

| Variable             | Description                                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `--color-foreground` | Color for the filled portion of the progress bar   |
| `--color-background` | Color for the unfilled portion of the progress bar |

### Accessibility

#### Implemented Accessibility Features

- [x] Semantic structure with appropriate ARIA role (`progressbar`)
- [x] Clear representation of current state using `aria-valuenow`
- [x] Proper range definition through `aria-valuemin` and `aria-valuemax`
- [x] Descriptive labels using either `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`
- [x] Visual indication of progress that doesn't rely solely on color
- [x] Consistent styling and behavior across different progress states
- [x] Support for different color themes while maintaining adequate contrast

#### Accessibility Considerations when Implementing

- [ ] Ensure the progress bar has sufficient color contrast between filled and unfilled portions
- [ ] Provide additional text descriptions for critical processes when appropriate
- [ ] Consider adding supplementary text for screen readers for important milestones
- [ ] For processes that take longer than a few seconds, consider adding estimated time remaining
- [ ] Update the `aria-valuenow` attribute dynamically when progress changes
- [ ] If using custom labels, ensure they clearly describe the purpose of the progress indicator
- [ ] For non-standard ranges, make sure `aria-valuemin` and `aria-valuemax` reflect the actual range
