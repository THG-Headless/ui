The accordion system provides two basic variations with different states and styling options. 

The two options have differing levels on functionality with the compromise being that the approach with the html based open/close mechanic lacks in accessibility.

## Example Usage
### Basic Accordion

The open close mechanic of this accordion will rely on Javascipt implementation. It follows best practises for accessibility.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/accordion/BasicAccordion.html">
    <BasicAccordion/>
</ShowComponent>

### Summary Accordion

This accordion has a basic open close mechanic from the details/summary tag used.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/accordion/SummaryAccordion.html">
    <SummaryAccordion/>
</ShowComponent>

### Named Summary Accordion

Building on the initial Summary accordion, the use of the name attribute on the details tag allows only one section to be open at a time.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/accordion/NamedSummaryAccordion.html">
    <NamedSummaryAccordion/>
</ShowComponent>


## CSS Variables

The accordion system can be customized using CSS variables:

### Layout and Sizing
| Variable | Default Value | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `--accordion-width` | `20rem` | Width of the accordion  |
| `--accordion-gap` | `0.5em` | Horizonal space between |
| `--accordion-wrapper-padding` | `5px` | Horizontal padding between the border of the accordion and its content |

### Trigger Configuration
| Variable | Default Value | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `--accordion-inner-margin` | `0px` | Shared value between trigger and content to align text |
| `--accordion-inner-padding` | `1em 1.5em` | Shared value between trigger and content to align text |


### Borders and Styling
| Variable | Default Value | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `--accordion-outline` | `auto` | Accessibiility feature on focussed content |
| `--accordion-title-weight` | `normal` | Font weight for the triggers |
| `--accordion-content-weight` | `normal` | Font weight for the content |
| `--accordion-trigger-hover` | `none` | Background color on hover |
| `--accordion-radius` | `7px` | Rounding on borders |
| `--accordion-border` | `none` | Border around the accordion |


## Accessibility

We propose two types of accordion in this package. The first relies on JS implementation to achieve its functionality. This version is the recommended default as it properly conforms to the standards of WCAG AA guidelines. 

An alternative is the use of the HTML details and summary tags, however at the time of development, these elements are not sufficiently advanced to provide the expected level of accessibility across all screen-readers, so we caution against its usage.

### Current Implementation Features

#### Structure and Labeling
> Each section of content in an accordion panel is wrapped in a `region` with a clear description of its purpose
> Every accordion section has aria to link the trigger / heading of the section to its content

#### Keyboard Support
The current implementation provides:
> Tab navigation between focusable elements
> Focus indicators on interactive elements
> ( Summary/Details Accordion Only )Space/Enter keys to open/close the dropdown (built-in with `<details>`)

#### Screen Reader Support

#### ARIA State Management
Update the following ARIA states dynamically:
- [ ] `aria-expanded` on an open accordion panel
- [ ] `aria-controls=ID` link the top level element around the trigger for an accordion panel
- [ ] Use role=region / `aria-labelledby` on the accordion content panel div, to demonstrate the link to the button controlling visibility

These steps will need to be done through JavaScript implementation

#### Keyboard Navigation
Implement the following keyboard interactions:
- [ ] Tab moves focus to the next focusable element
- [ ] Shift /Tab moves focus to the previous focusable element
- [ ] Enter/Space expands a collapsed tab
