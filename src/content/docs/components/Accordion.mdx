<Aside type="caution">

There are two HTML templates laid out for the accordion, (Named) Summary Accordion and WCAG Accordion. 

The summary accordions using the details and summary tags have some CSS powered functionality, but we cannot gaurantee that this pattern matches WCAG2.1 criteria.

If using the Altitude Commerce starter kits, there is a Javascript based solution for the Accordion also provided, that confirms to WCAG best practises.

## Example Usage

### Summary Accordion

This accordion has a basic open close mechanic from the details/summary tag used.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/accordion/SummaryAccordion.html">
  <SummaryAccordion />
</ShowComponent>

### Named Summary Accordion

Building on the initial Summary accordion, the use of the name attribute on the details tag allows only one section to be open at a time.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/accordion/NamedSummaryAccordion.html">
  <NamedSummaryAccordion />
</ShowComponent>
{/* 
### Style Override Example

This is identical in functionality to the previous accordion, but demonstrates the styling flexibility of the accordion css variables

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/accordion/NamedSummaryAccordion.html">
  <div
    style={{
      '--accordion-gap': '0.5em',
      '--accordion-divider-width': 'none',
      '--accordion-radius': 'var(--radius-sm)',
      '--accordion-section-radius': 'var(--radius-sm)',
      '--accordion-box-shadow': 'var(--shadow-md)',
    }}

>

    <NamedSummaryAccordion />

  </div>
</ShowComponent> */}

## CSS Variables

The accordion system can be customized using CSS variables:

### Layout and Sizing

## Accessibility

Using the pattern of the html details and summary tags allows the open/close interactivity of the accordion. To make it WCAG compliant and to activate some css based on aria changes, some Javascript will need to be implemented in the final version.


### Current Implementation Features

#### Structure and Labeling

> Each trigger has a role of button to indicate it's interactivity to screen readers.
> Every accordion section has aria to link the trigger / heading of the section to its content

#### Keyboard Support

The current implementation provides:

> Tab navigation between focusable elements
> Focus indicators on interactive elements
> Space/Enter keys to open/close the dropdown

#### Screen Reader Support

#### ARIA State Management

Update the following ARIA states dynamically:

- [ ] `aria-expanded` This should be toggled with javascript
- [ ] `aria-controls=ID` link the top level element around the trigger for an accordion panel
- [ ] Use role=region / `aria-labelledby` on the accordion content panel div, to demonstrate the link to the button controlling visibility

This is not a typical implementation of aria and accessibility. It is known to work against Android talkback and Apple VoiceOver screen-readers. If a fully WCAG compliant version is needed, please refer to the WCAGAccordion example. This will need Javascript implementation to make it interactive.

#### Keyboard Navigation

These are met by default, but after any Javascript additions to the accordion, it should be confirmed that they are still met:

- [ ] Tab moves focus to the next focusable element
- [ ] Shift / Tab moves focus to the previous focusable element
- [ ] Enter / Space expands a collapsed tab
