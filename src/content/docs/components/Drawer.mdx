### Drawer

The drawer component is a modal sidebar built on top of the native `<dialog>` element. It provides a smooth sliding animation and a seamless user experience across both desktop and mobile devices.
The default implementation slides in from the left when opened and snaps closed when dismissed. It includes a semi-transparent blurred background and can be closed using the ESC key or by clicking on the background.
The drawer is fully accessible with ARIA attributes and supports both mouse and keyboard navigation.
