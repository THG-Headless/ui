## Pips

Pip indicators provide an accessible way to navigate between items in a carousel or similar component. They use native radio inputs styled to provide a visual indicator of the current selection.

The pip indicators are built using native HTML radio inputs, providing built-in accessibility and state management without JavaScript. Each pip expands when selected and includes proper ARIA labels for screen readers.

### Accessibility

#### Implemented Accessibility Features

- [x] Complete keyboard navigation support through native radio controls
- [x] Semantic structure using `radiogroup` role
- [x] Clear descriptive labels for navigation ("Show item X of Y")
- [x] Purpose description via `aria-description` for keyboard usage
- [x] Screen reader context through `sr-only` class
- [x] Visual focus indicators through native radio states
- [x] Proper use of semantic HTML with `<label>` elements
- [x] Current state indication through native radio checked state
- [x] Content relationships via `aria-controls`
- [x] Touch-friendly target sizes through label wrapping
- [x] Motion-respecting animations using `prefers-reduced-motion`
- [x] Consistent naming patterns across all controls

#### Accessibility Considerations when Implementing

- [ ] Ensure radio input names are unique per instance
- [ ] Match `aria-controls` values with corresponding content IDs
- [ ] Maintain proper tab order matching visual presentation
- [ ] Consider auto-advance pause on focus/hover
- [ ] Handle dynamic content updates appropriately
- [ ] Maintain state synchronization between controls and content
