# Carousel (work in progress)

## CSS Scroll snapping + anchor jump links

based on [this resource](https://css-tricks.com/css-only-carousel/)

* con: anchor jumping is jarring (when you use the bullets to navigate it jumps vertically to a particular section)

* con: horizontal scrollbar is visible


### No left/right arrows, one slide in view at a time

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/NoJS.html">
  <NoJS />
</ShowComponent>

### To do

- [ ] make margins show up again when I wrap the whole thing in an `@layer components { }` 
- [ ] try one with left/right arrows
- [ ] do a carousel with multiple slides in view at a time
- [ ] do a carousel 
- [ ] try using js to fix the cons in the above implementation
- [ ] check out [google's recommendation]()
- [ ] clearly define the 'props' of this component (i.e width, colors palette, array of slides to display )
## Some JS
