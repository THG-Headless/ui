import ShowComponent from "@components/doc-helpers/ShowComponent.astro";
import Carousel from "@components/carousel/Carousel.html";

## Variations

### Product Carousel

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/Carousel.html">
  <Carousel />
</ShowComponent>

### Product Carousel with Disabled bullets. 

the "active" bullet is styled according to the THG figma and has to be dyanmically applied using client-side javascript.

### Product Carousel with CSS-Only bullets

the bullet functionality is implemented using CSS. The downside of this approach is 'anchor jumping', which happens when you click a slide and the viewport jumps in the vertical direction.

### Variables

```
--carousel-gap: (1rem default)
```


## Full Width Carousel

## Product List with Left/Right buttons

* con: anchor jumping is jarring (when you use the bullets to navigate it jumps vertically to a particular section)
* con: horizontal scrollbar is visible


## Accessibility

The button system is designed with accessibility in mind:

- ✅ Use of semantic html tags (`ul` and `li`)
- ✅ Supports keyboard-only navigation. 
- ⚠️ Does not provide descriptive text for screen readers.

## Implementation tips

* It's good practice to wrap the 'carousel' element in a `<section`>
