Used to display lists of cards in a horizontally scrollable area.

## Slides

Swipe across to see remaining slides.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/BasicCarousel.html">
  <BasicCarousel />
</ShowComponent>

## Bullets

Indicate the remaining unseen slides. Use the `carousel-bullet-hover` and `carousel-bullet-active` modifiers to style the hover and active states. These will need to be applied and removed with JavaScript.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/CarouselBullets.html">
  <Bullets />
</ShowComponent>

## Controls

Use these to navigate between slides.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/CarouselControls.html">
  <CarouselControls />
</ShowComponent>

They use the`btn` class (see [Button](/components/button/)), and additional styling is applied by the `carousel-control-btn` modifier class.

## Examples

### Hero banner

Use for full-width slides.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/CarouselBanner.html">
  <CarouselBanner />
</ShowComponent>

### Product Rail

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/ProductRail_withBulletsAndControls.html">
  <ProductRail_withBulletsAndControls />
</ShowComponent>

### Product Rail w/ Additional Controls

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/ProductRail_withBulletsAndControls.html">
  <ProductRail_Additional />
</ShowComponent>

- [x] Each slide container has role group with the property `aria-roledescription` set to slide.
- [x] You can to tab through the slides using `Tab` and `Shift+Tab`

- see [this guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/carousel/#wai-ariaroles,states,andproperties) for more information

## Interactivity

- [ ] When implementing interactivity for the buttons and pips, we recommended to use the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) to add interactivity.
