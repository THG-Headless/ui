import ShowComponent from "@components/doc-helpers/ShowComponent.astro";
import ProductCarousel from "@components/carousel/ProductCarousel.html";
import HeroCarousel from "@components/carousel/HeroCarousel.html";

## Variations

### Product Carousel

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/ProductCarousel.html">
  <ProductCarousel />
</ShowComponent>

JavScript is needed to make the bullets change styling based on the slide that's in view, for instance using the intersection observer API.

### Hero Carousel

Exactly the same as above, but with: `width: 100%` applied to every `carousel-item` using the `w-full` utility class

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/HeroCarousel.html">
  <HeroCarousel />
</ShowComponent>

### Product Carousel with Disabled bullets.


### Notes
- the `tabIndex="0"` attributes ensures that we can tab through carousel items. This ensures compliance[^1]. 
- The bullets have no functionality by default, this has to be applied with JavaScript. 

### Variables

```
--carousel-gap: (1rem default)
```

## Product List with Left/Right buttons

- con: anchor jumping is jarring (when you use the bullets to navigate it jumps vertically to a particular section)
- con: horizontal scrollbar is visible

## Accessibility

* Use of semantic html tags (`ul` and `li`) to display content
* <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Tab</kbd> are used to tab through the `<li class="carousel-item">`s

## Implementation tips

- It's good practice to wrap the 'carousel' element in a `<section`>
