Used to show images or content in a horizontally scrollable area. Interactivity of bullets and controls has to be added with JavaScript.

## Building Blocks

### Carousel Slides

Allows users to swipe across to see multiple slides.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/CarouselBasic.html">
  <CarouselBasic />
</ShowComponent>

### Bullets

A subtle indicator of the remaining unseen slides. Use the `carousel-bullet-hover` and `carousel-bullet-active` modifiers to style the hover and active states. These will need to be applied and removed with JavaScript.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/CarouselBullets.html">
  <Bullets />
</ShowComponent>

### Controls

Use these to navigate between slides. They use the`btn` class (see [Button](/components/button/)), and additional styling is applied by the `carousel-control-btn` modifier class.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/CarouselControls.html">
  <CarouselControls />
</ShowComponent>

## Examples

### Hero banner

Use for full-width slides.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/CarouselBanner.html">
  <CarouselBanner />
</ShowComponent>

### Product Rail

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/ProductRail_withBulletsAndControls.html">
  <ProductRail_withBulletsAndControls />
</ShowComponent>

### Example 3 - Product Rail with Additional Controls

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/ProductRail_withBulletsAndControls.html">
  <ProductRail_Additional />
</ShowComponent>

### Banner

### Product Rail

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/CarouselControls_ProductRail.html">
  <CarouselControls_ProductRail />
</ShowComponent>

## Product Rail with Additional Controls

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/CarouselControls_ProductRail_Additional.html">
  <ProductRail_Additional />
</ShowComponent>

### Variables (TODO)

The carousel can be customized with the following variables:

| Variable | default |
| -------- | ------- |
|          |         |

## Notes

- Note that the carousel-item by default

## Accessibility

- Use of semantic html tags (`ul` and `li`) to display content
- The `tabindex="0"` attributes ensures that we can use `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` to tab through carousel items.

## JavaScript implementation

- You will need to add JavaScript to the bullets and the controls for them to function properly.
