Used to show images or content in a horizontally scrollable area.


## Variations

### Product Carousel

Use this if you need multiple slides in view at any one time. 

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/ProductCarousel.html">
  <ProductCarousel />
</ShowComponent>

Users can scroll through the items using their mouse or trackpad. Items can be tabbed through with `tab` and `shift tab`.
The little 'bullets' at the bottom have no functionality by default; this has to be applied with JavaScript.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/HeroCarousel.html">
  <HeroCarousel />
</ShowComponent>

* Use of semantic html tags (`ul` and `li`) to display content
* The `tabindex="0"` attributes ensures that we can use `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` to tab through carousel items.
