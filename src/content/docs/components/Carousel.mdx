# Carousel 

### Basic Product Carousel


* Full width by default (takes up the size of its parent container)
* Responsive to the size of its children (can be anything as long as they have the class `.carousel-slide`)
* Carousel is reponsive to the sizes of the product cards inside it


<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/Carousel.html">
  <Carousel />
</ShowComponent>


### Variables

```
--carousel-gap: (1rem default)
```

### To do

- [ ] make not break when I wrap the whole thing in an `@layer components { }` 
- [ ] try one with left/right arrows
- [ ] try using js to fix the cons in the above implementation
- [ ] clearly define the 'props' of this component (i.e width, colors palette, array of slides to display )
- [x] do a carousel with multiple slides in view at a time


## Full Width Carousel

## Product List with Left/Right buttons

* con: anchor jumping is jarring (when you use the bullets to navigate it jumps vertically to a particular section)
* con: horizontal scrollbar is visible


## Accessibility

The button system is designed with accessibility in mind:

- ✅ Use of semantic html tags (`ul` and `li`)
- ✅ Supports keyboard-only navigation. 
- ⚠️ Does not provide descriptive text for screen readers.

## Implementation tips

* It's good practice to wrap the 'carousel' element in a `<section`>
