import ShowComponent from "@components/doc-helpers/ShowComponent.astro";
import ProductCarousel from "@components/carousel/ProductCarousel.html";
import HeroCarousel from "@components/carousel/HeroCarousel.html";

## Variations

### Product Carousel

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/ProductCarousel.html">
  <ProductCarousel />
</ShowComponent>

JavScript is needed to make the bullets change styling based on the slide that's in view, for instance using the intersection observer API.

### Hero Carousel

Exactly the same as above, but with: `width: 100%` applied to every `carousel-item` using the `w-full` utility class

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/HeroCarousel.html">
  <HeroCarousel />
</ShowComponent>

### Product Carousel with Disabled bullets.

the "active" bullet is styled according to the THG figma and has to be dynamically applied using client-side javascript.

### Product Carousel with CSS-Only bullets

the bullet functionality is implemented using CSS. The downside of this approach is 'anchor jumping', which happens when you click a slide and the viewport jumps in the vertical direction.

### Variables

```
--carousel-gap: (1rem default)
```

## Product List with Left/Right buttons

- con: anchor jumping is jarring (when you use the bullets to navigate it jumps vertically to a particular section)
- con: horizontal scrollbar is visible

## Accessibility

The button system is designed with accessibility in mind:

- ✅ Use of semantic html tags (`ul` and `li`)
- ✅ Supports keyboard-only navigation.
- ⚠️ Does not provide descriptive text for screen readers.

## Implementation tips

- It's good practice to wrap the 'carousel' element in a `<section`>

## JavaScript

This CSS-only implementation is lacking the following functionality, for which there are JS solutions:

- Keyboard navigation (users should be able to toggle through the different `carousel-items` by pressing tab)
