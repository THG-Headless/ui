Used to show images or content in a horizontally scrollable area.

## Slides

Allows users to swipe across to see multiple slides.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/BasicCarousel.html">
  <BasicCarousel />
</ShowComponent>

## Bullets

A subtle indicator of the remaining unseen slides. Use the `carousel-bullet-hover` and `carousel-bullet-active` modifiers to style the hover and active states. These will need to be applied and removed with JavaScript.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/CarouselBullets.html">
  <Bullets />
</ShowComponent>

## Controls

Use these to navigate between slides. They use the`btn` class (see [Button](/components/button/)), and additional styling is applied by the `carousel-control-btn` modifier class.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/CarouselControls.html">
  <CarouselControls />
</ShowComponent>

## Examples

### Hero banner

Use for full-width slides.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/CarouselBanner.html">
  <CarouselBanner />
</ShowComponent>

### Product Rail

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/ProductRail_withBulletsAndControls.html">
  <ProductRail_withBulletsAndControls />
</ShowComponent>

### Product Rail w/ Additional Controls

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/ProductRail_withBulletsAndControls.html">
  <ProductRail_Additional />
</ShowComponent>

### Variables

The carousel can be customized with the following variables:

| Variable                       | default              |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `--carousel-width`             | 100%                 |
| `--carousel-item-gap`          | 1rem                 |
| `--carousel-dummy-image-color` | var(--secondary-300) |
| `--carousel-bullet-color`      | var(--neutral-300)   |

## Accessibility

- The CSS-only version is not WCAG 2.1 compliant by default. You should add the correct aria attributes in your markup (these will somewhat depend on the use case of the carousel)
- Please see https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/carousel/ for more information

## Implementation Notes

When implementing a carousel:

### Ensuring compliance with A11y

- Make sure to add the correct [aria labels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/carousel/#wai-ariaroles,states,andproperties) to make the component accessible. I.e
  - Ensure that aria labels for slides are correct.
  - Make sure the carousel container has the aria-roledescription property set to carousel.
  - Make sure each slide has an accessible name
  - Make sure each slide container has role group with the property aria-roledescription set to slide.

### Adding interactivity

- You may want to use the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) to add interactivity.
