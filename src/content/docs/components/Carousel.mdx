Used to show images or content in a horizontally scrollable area. Is composed of a `carousel` > `carousel-items` and a `carousel-bullet-wrapper` > `carousel-bullet`

# Examples

# Product Rail

Use this if you need multiple slides in view at any one time.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/ProductRail.html">
  <ProductRail />
</ShowComponent>

- Users can scroll through the items using their mouse or trackpad.

- The little `carousel-bullet-wrapper` at the bottom have no functionality by default; this has to be applied with JavaScript.

## Hero Banner

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/Banner.html">
  <Carousel />
</ShowComponent>

This version is identical to the [Product Rail](<#Product Rail>) `--carousel-item-width: 100%` through the `carousel-item-fullwidth` modifier

## Carousel Control Variations

These are used to navigate between slides

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/CarouselControls.html">
  <CarouselControls />
</ShowComponent>

### Banner

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/CarouselControls_Banner.html">
  <CarouselControls_Banner />
</ShowComponent>

### Product Rail

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/CarouselControls_ProductRail.html">
  <CarouselControls_ProductRail />
</ShowComponent>

## Bullets

The bullets are not functional without JavaScript. Use the `carousel-bullet-hover` and `carousel-bullet-active` modifiers to style the hover and active states.

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/CarouselBullets.html">
  <Bullets />
</ShowComponent>

## Product Rail with Additional Controls

<ShowComponent filePath="./src/components/carousel/CarouselControls_ProductRail_Additional.html">
  <CarouselControls_ProductRail_Additional />
</ShowComponent>

### Variables (TODO)

The carousel can be customized with the following variables:

| Variable | default |
| -------- | ------- |
|          |         |

## Notes

- Note that the carousel-item by default

## Accessibility

- Use of semantic html tags (`ul` and `li`) to display content
- The `tabindex="0"` attributes ensures that we can use `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` to tab through carousel items.

## JavaScript implementation

- You will need to add JavaScript to the bullets and the controls for them to function properly.
